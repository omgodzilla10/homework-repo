The output files were generated by the following commands in Linux.
(These commands should also work in the cygwin bash shell):

./a1 _data1_ < in1 2> out1
./a1 _data2_ < in2 2> out2
./a1 _data3_ < in3 2> out3
./a1 _data4_ < in4 2> out4

The above assumes that the program can be invoked using ./a1. The data files
_data1_, _data2_, _data3_ & _data4_ may or may not exist at the start of 
the program.  (If they did not exist before the program started, they would
be created; otherwise, their contents are deleted.)

You may be able to use the runtests script to run the tests in Linux or 
cygwin.  Put your executable program (which must be named a1 in Linux or a1.exe
in cygwin) in this directory (the a1tests directory) & type:

./runtests

Note that the cmp program must be installed in order for this to work.  

Note that these tests are not exhaustive.  We may run more tests when
grading your assignment.
